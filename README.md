## LiGAPUv2 is coming soon
We are currently organizing the codebase and further optimizing the network architecture and computational efficiency. The updated version is expected to be released in the near future.
## Environment Setup
python==3.7.5<br>
pytorch==1.10.0<br>
numpy==1.21.2<br>
einops==0.3.2<br>
scikit-learn==1.0.0<br>
CUDA==11.3<br>
